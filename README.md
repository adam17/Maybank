This repository has been created so that [Adam] and myself can work together on designing and developing a website for a local company.

The aim of the project is to encourage & allow us to:

+ Practise and develop our existing skillset
+ Learn and use modern design features
+ Learn and explore new technologies<br />
  - In this project so far we have learnt:
    1. GitHub's branch and pull requests features
+ Learn from each other
+ Have the experience of working in a team for web development<br />
  (An example of this is using GitHub's features such as pull requests which we wouldn't normally use)
