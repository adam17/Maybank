- Get rid of 6th picture. I admit, it was bad ;)
- Restore prev/next buttons.
- We do not need the loader bar any more. It **was** pure CSS:
```css
  #loader {
    margin-top:-4px;
    width: 100%;
    height: 3px;
    background: #7a5e2a;
    animation-name: s3loader;
    animation-duration: 3s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  }
  @keyframes s3loader {
    from { width: 0%; }
    to { width: 100%; }
  }
```
- I noticed that our webpage does not work correctly when there is no internet
connection due to missing jQuery. That's why I add a local copy of it.
- Pictures: /Images/Sign-writing.jpg is 1024x768 where the 2 other are 650x400.
- Text and pictures replaced.
- Other minor changes to the style.css.
